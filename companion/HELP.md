### Preset Templates

Brightness level presets are generated using Companion 4.3's template system. Each screen gets a set of brightness buttons (100% down to 0% in 5% steps) that automatically set brightness and save to hardware with a 100ms delay. Feedback highlights the button matching current brightness.
